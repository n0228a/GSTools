"""
GStools subpackage providing correlogram models for collocated cokriging.

.. currentmodule:: gstools.cokriging.correlogram

Correlogram models define the cross-covariance structure between primary
and secondary variables in collocated cokriging. Different models make
different assumptions about the spatial relationship between variables.

Base Class
^^^^^^^^^^

.. autosummary::
   :toctree:

   Correlogram

Markov Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. autosummary::
   :toctree:

   MarkovModel1

Future Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Planned implementations:
    - MarkovModel2: Uses secondary variable's spatial structure
    - LinearModelCoregionalization: Full multivariate model
